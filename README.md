# Kickstiny: Enhanced Kick Embedded Player

A userscript that replaces the controls in the Kick embedded player with custom controls that offer a volume slider, quality selector, and more.

### Rewind on Bigscreen

When Kick makes a recording of the current broadcast available, a timeline appears inline with the controls on destiny.gg/bigscreen. Drag it to watch an earlier moment. The channel name and dot turn gray while rewound; select the channel to **Go to live**, reloading only the Kick embed and leaving Bigscreen and chat in place.

While rewound, **Playback Speed** in the settings menu offers speeds from 0.5× to 2×. It's hidden when live. Returning to live, including catching up to the recording's end, resets playback to 1×.

On smaller embeds, the timeline moves to a second row to leave room for seeking. On phone-sized screens, the bar also hides the volume slider and shows a timestamp above the timeline thumb only while dragging. A compact red/gray **LIVE** indicator sits beside the timeline; tap it while rewound to return to live.

Rewind uses Kick's existing recording and player. The recording can take a few minutes to appear and trails the live feed; channels without an available recording keep the usual controls. Chat stays live while you rewind.

## How to Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your web browser
2. Click [here](https://r2cdn.destiny.gg/kickstiny/kickstiny.user.js) to open the userscript in the Tampermonkey dashboard, which will prompt you to install
3. Click "Install"

> Note: Chrome and Edge users must enable **both** "Developer Mode" on the extensions page and the "Allow User Scripts" Tampermonkey setting for userscripts to work. See the [Tampermonkey FAQ](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209) for more details/guidance.

## Development

The development setup works around browser limitations: importing the compiled userscript from a file URL works in Chrome, but isn't allowed in Firefox. To support both browsers, we run a simple HTTP server that serves the file on localhost and use a dummy userscript that loads the real userscript from localhost on page load. The build process auto-compiles on change, and changes are reflected in the browser on reload.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

2. Start the dev server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   > Note: This runs esbuild in watch mode and the HTTP server concurrently.

3. Install the dummy Tampermonkey script, `dev/kickstiny-dummy.user.js`

4. Navigate to any `https://player.kick.com/*` URL
